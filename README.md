## Ideas Backlog
- bluedot-intro-to-transformative-ai
  - Write blog about insights and perspectives from the resources, and discussion of each session
- two-books
  - Write blog comparing two books in a subject area
  - Motivations for reading them
  - Each book's position and context about authors and general community discussion around each one (critiques, ideas that have held on, reactions and what has happend as a result)
  - Key points
  - Key examples
  - Personal takeaways and connections I made between these books, and other things I've read
  - Connections, open discussion questions and things I'd love to hear about if I was to run a reading group on this
- two-papers
  - Same outline as two-books
  - Highlighting two ideas (different applications, or temporally different with one inspiring the other, or two seminal ideas that came together to inspire something hugely relevant today)
  - Create collection of papers and their relationships with one another as a Notion table that folks can suggest relationships between and star popular relationships they'd like to see compared (use this database of potential connections to triangulate which are promising connections to explore)
